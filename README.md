Hello, My name is Pranaav Sriram. I am a graduating high school senior at the time of the creation of this portfolio. The following is a portfolio of my work throughout the first 9 weeks of my semester-long iOS development class. This class is structured as a self-taught sandbox, enabling me to gain experience and knowledge through experimentation as well as trial and error. I intially began learning Swift by watching Youtube tutorial videos on how to use the Xcode software. This sparked my interest to learn more and I transitioned over to writing code and evaluating its validty and efficiency.

Many of the apps I created during this 9 week period were entirely practice projects which I worked on solely to gain experience. Upon learning the basics I chose to focus on one app for the remaining weeks. This app would serve as a culmination of numerous skills I had practiced and learned over my inital learning phase.

Over the next 9 weeks or so I intend to learn more about how to add graphics, how to include a database to my existng app and also learn more about CloudKit. I anticipate that learning more about these features will further increase the versatility of my future apps.

I hope that this portfolio provides an overview of my work throughout the first term of my iOS development class and captures my developed skillset and overall interest in learning more moving forward.

## My Work

### [Quiz Bowl Scorekeeper](https://github.com/90310844/Quiz-Bowl-Scorekeeper) (Scalable)
Quiz Bowl Scorekeeper is passion project of mine that has dominated the better part of the past 9 weeks. The idea for this app came about when I realized that during Quiz Bowl practices my teammates and I did not have a proper tool to record game statistics. This app primarily utilizes two UIs, one for a tradiational scorekeeper and another for an advanced scorekeeper which logs the statisitcs of 8 players. The skills I needed to learn before bringing this vision to fruition were: Setting constraints to all of the UI objects, connecting a launching button with other storyboards, and most importantly the syntax for writing code in Swift. I collaborated on this app with my friend and classmate Varun Saini. Varun worked almost exclusively on developing the algorithms to update the score and counter labels. He provided a great deal of input in terms of what features the app should include. His suggestion lead to us implementing a reset button as well as seemless transition between the main scoreboard and the advanced scoreboard. After working this app for approximately 6 weeks we are almost ready to sumbit it for review by the app store. Over the remainder of the course both Varun and I plan to add features to this app such as a database where scoresheet from previously recorded games could be saved. We may also submit a future version of this app to be endorsed or certified by NAQT (National Academic Quiz Tournaments); the largest overseer of middle school, high school and college Quiz Bowl tournaments in the United States.
